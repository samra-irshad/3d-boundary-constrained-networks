# Improved 3D abdominal multi-organ segmentation via boundary-constrained models

Pytorch Code for the paper "Improved 3D abdominal multi-organ segmentation via boundary-constrained models"

This repository contains pytorch implementation corresponding to single-task (baseline) and multi-task (boundary-constrained) models.

# 3D baseline models:
Implementation for baseline models is in script [here](https://github.com/samra-irshad/3d-multitask-unet/blob/main/model/baseline_models.py)
